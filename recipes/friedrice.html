    <h2>How to make fried rice</h2>
    <p>
      Making fried rice is a breeze with the recipe you'll find below. The
      process is simple — preheat your pan before swirling in oil and aromatics,
      then add uncooked proteins if applicable. Add in rice and vegetables,
      vigorously tossing ingredients for that toasty, golden-brown color that
      signals big flavor.
